I've been gaming since Dos (King's Quest) before I became 6'8\" (really). I used to \"break\" games for a living.\r\n\r\nMy focus is on entertainment, discussion, and chat interaction. I don't generally follow the \"meta.\" I like to shape it myself with inventive play styles that are a challenge. I like to play the class or character that's considered the most difficult to use. Or play a game on its highest difficulty. Which leads to a unique and memorable experience for you and me. :)\r\n\r\nAfter I'm able to maintain my stream. I plan on donating 20% of every future contribution to a charity. I also plan on doing giveaways. Setting up points (Coins) for viewers to earn. And overall improve the channel's content.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to earn partner of Twitch, and have that coin be the sub icon for the cents! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTips are not expected, but sincerely appreciated! Any contribution supports my desire to maintain streaming full-time instead of taking this government job.\r\n\r\nTop Investors!\r\nThe_White_Light: $148.00 \r\no0talula0o: $55.00 \r\nAcydwarp: $50.00\r\nBarglenis: $50.00 \r\nYOURAWESOME: $21.00 \r\nHounding: $20.00\r\nJookz: $17.01\r\nSmooth: $14.60 \r\nBeckiesweckers: $10.00 (FIRST INVESTOR)\r\nApollyon: $10.00\r\nDunnoxBurfoot: $10.00\r\nDDrogba: $10.00\r\nTharnosil: $10.00 Nin10dont: $10.00\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday to Friday: 8:00 PM PST\r\nSaturday: Check Twitter!\r\nSunday: Check Twitter!\r\n\r\nI tweet often before I'm going to air! So be sure to keep in the loop!\r\n\r\nAnd if you'd like to suggest a time I go live, be sure to message me with the day and time zone of your request!\r\n\r\n\r\nNo links without permission.\r\nThis is the internet. Swear all you want. But nothing sexually explicit.\r\nNo backseat gaming...unless Coin asks.\r\nNo spoilers or hints. Some people wait until the series ended to binge.\r\nNo spamming of symbols to flood chat\r\nNo personal information\r\nNo drama. There's enough drama in our lives. My chat is not a place for it. Don't detract from what this community is about.\r\nIf you are timed out or banned: I'm very selective of my moderators. I trust their discretion. My rules are mostly common courtesy. If you have been timed out or banned, there's probably a reason for it. I will read your side if you message me. And then decide from there.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy moderators not only keep my channel chat running smoothly, but they also enhance the viewing experience. They do this by being helpful in chat, enforcing the rules, and stimulating conversation.\r\n\r\nInterested in helping this community out? Below is what I'm looking for in a moderator. If you agree with then send me a message! Tell me what you think these mean to you. Put some effort in your message.\r\n\r\nThe core qualities of a moderator:\r\n1. Channel and chat presence\r\n2. Patient and Aware\r\n3. Objective, fair, yet firm\r\n4. Team and Yourself\r\n\r\nSo tell me what that means to you, and if you have any past moderator experience, list and provide some information about it in the message. Along with anything you'd like me to consider.\r\n\r\nThanks! :D\r\n\r\nFeatured Streamers\r\n\r\nYanoobshow A 14-year old kid who is already on his way to a career as a gamer! He is playing a lot of Cross Fire Sacplayin A very good friend who once was a random gamer at first.

THANK YOU! Still need people with video editing, and flash prowess!\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in volunteering to help make this channel and my videos more aesthetically pleasing please message me! sylvacointv@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nDO I HAVE TO WIN?\r\n\r\nGiven the choice to win against someone worse than me or lose to someone better, I'll always choose the latter. Because then there's a challenge. And I play to have fun. And try strategies most won't.\r\n\r\nMETA\r\n\r\nI do not play the game just to follow what everyone else is doing because it's what's winning/best. If you challenge the meta, you can change it.\r\n\r\nPAY2WIN, PAY2WIN-NOW, and PAY2PLAY\r\n\r\nPay2Win:Not all available content is provided with the released title. This is going to diminish a game's community. \r\nPay2Win-Right-Now:The free option of grinding to upgrade is available. \r\nLook at Diablo III. I grinded, and farmed in order to get gear so I could solo Diablo on Inferno. That's one way of playing it. With the introduction of the real money auction house, players could just buy whatever items they wanted for a quick, casual game. Same thing for the current raged about game, Hearthstone. Yes, you can use cash to buy packs. You can also use gold. But note: you still have to open the packs. Spending money doesn't increase your odds. \r\nPay2Play:The most current example I can think of is Evolve. The game is $60. But if you want the additional hunters, it's $25. And the monsters are $15 per. That's absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn case you were curious about some behind the scenes info! :) Click the pic to see it in the res of my monitor: 1920 x1080. Yep.
